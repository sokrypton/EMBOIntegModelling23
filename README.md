- Tutorial - alphafold advanced
  1. Use this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/EMBOIntegModelling23/blob/main/alphafold_advanced.ipynb)
  2. Use PyMol (or any 3D viewer) to compare [1X0O](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/1x0o) to [2K7S](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/2k7s), how are these different?
  3. If you model both sequences, what conformation do you get?
